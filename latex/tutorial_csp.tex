\section{Tutorial}
\label{tutorial_csp}

The objective of this chapter is to get you to a stage where you can use BMotion Studio to visualize CSP-M models. 
We expect that you have already downloaded the BMotion Studio tool (see Section~\ref{installation}) and created a new visualization template for Event-B visualizations (see Section~\ref{vis_template}).
 
%We expect you to have a basic understanding of logic and an idea why doing formal modelling is a good idea.  
You should be able to work through the tutorial with no or little outside help.
We encourage you not to download solutions to the examples but instead to actively build them up yourself as the tutorial progresses.
If something is unclear, remember to check the Reference (\ref{reference_csp}) for more information.

\subsection{Preparation}

Let's start by creating a new visualization template as described in Section~\ref{vis_template}.
Just download the \file{bms-csp-template.zip}{predefined template}.
Decompress the archive and rename the folder to \texttt{bully}.

\subsection{The Formal Model}

We are going to create a visualization of the bully algorithm specification found in the book ``Understanding Concurrent Systems'' (ISBN 978-1-84882-258-0).
The algorithm represents a method of distributed computing for electing a node to be the coordinator amongst a group of nodes.
Each node has a unique ID and the algorithm intends to select the node with the highest ID to be the coordinator.
It is assumed that the nodes may fail and revive from time to time and the communication between the nodes is reliable.
Three types of messages are defined within the design of the algorithm: \textit{election} (announcing an election), \textit{answer} (responding to an election message), and \textit{coordinator} (announcing the identity of the coordinator).

The bully algorithm specification defines six additional types of events needed for the formalisation of the algorithm in CSP:
the \textit{fail} and \textit{revive} events (for modelling failing and reviving of a node), the \textit{test} and \textit{ok} events (for simulating a test-response communication), the \textit{leader} events (for indicating the coordinator of a living node), and the \textit{tock} event (for modelling timeouts and time).

The CSP model is included in the following archive file: \url{www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ucs/ucsexamples.tar.gz}\footnote{The archive contains CSP examples of the book ``Understanding Concurrent Systems'' (ISBN 978-1-84882-258-0). See \url{http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ucs/CSPM.html}.}.
Download and decompress the archive.
The file called \texttt{bully.csp} is incldued in the folder \texttt{chapter14}.
Copy the \texttt{bully.csp} file into a new folder called \texttt{model} relative to your \texttt{index.html} file.

\subsection{Link the Model with the Visualisation}

The next step consists of linking the model with the visualization.
For this, open the \texttt{bmotion.json} file with an editor of your choice and set the \textit{model} property to ``model/bully.csp''.
This links the visualization with the CSP-Model called ``bully.csp''.

\subsection{Creating the Actual Visualisation}
\label{tutorial_csp_create_vis}

The next step consists of creating the actual visualization.
The user is not restricted to an editor in order to create a visualization.
The user can make use of any tool that support the creation of SVG graphics or HTML documents.
Please download the prepared \file{bully.svg}{bully.svg} file.
Feel free to modify and explore the SVG graphic.
Open the SVG file with a text editor of your choice and put the SVG code within the body tag in the \texttt{index.html} file located in your workspace.

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering

\end{figure}

In general, we want to visualise the process of electing a leader in the network.
More precisely, we aim to visualise the $Network$ process of the CSP specification.
As the bully algorithm specification is presented for a network with four nodes, we also intend to create a visualization for four nodes (the nodes are enumerated from 0 to 3). 
Fig.~\ref{fig:BullyVisState} demonstrates the visualization of a particular trace.

There are two major aspects of the specification that we want to visualise: the nodes and the communication between the nodes.
Each node is visualised by means of a circle in which the respective ID is positioned, whereas the communication between the nodes is illustrated by directed arrows.
Each directed arrow is made up of a line and a corresponding arrowhead.

To each visual element in the visualization we assign a unique ID referring to the elements in the CSP specification.
Thus, the node with ID $x$ in the CSP specification is presented by the circle with ID "n-x" in the visualization.
Additionally, a message transfer from the node with ID $x$ to the node with ID $y$ is represented by the line with ID "l-x-y" and the arrowhead with ID "p-y" (i.e. the arrow connecting "n-x" and "n-y").
In this section, both symbols $x$ and $y$ stand for an integer ranging from 0 to 3.

We can classify all types of events in the specification into the following groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{status:} Events that can change the status of a particular node $x$: $fail.x$, $revive.x$, $coordinator.x.y$, and $leader.x.y$.
\item \textbf{message:} Events illustrating a message transfer from node $x$ to node $y$: $test.x.y$, $ok.x.y$, $election.x.y$, $answer.x.y$, and $coordinator.x.y$.
\item \textbf{hidden:} Events that are not considered in the visualization: $tock$.
\end{itemize}
Thus, we can infer that there are two general types of observers to define: the \textit{status} and the \textit{message} observers.
Note that each \textit{coordinator} event (\textit{coordinator.x.y}) has been included in the first two groups above. 
This is because in the specification each of the \textit{coordinator} events intends to identify the coordinator ($x$) and at the same time represents a message transfer (to node $y$).

The status of a node usually changes when one of the \textit{status} events has been executed.
Each node, except for the node with the lowest ID\footnote{The node with ID 0 can never be a coordinator as there is no node with a lower ID.}, can have the following status: \texttt{failed}, \texttt{revived}, \texttt{coordinator}, or \texttt{coordinated}.
A unique colour has been selected for distinguishing each possible status of a node (see legend in Fig.~\ref{fig:BullyVisState}).
For instance, the node with ID ``n-3'' will be coloured in grey when the event $fail.3$ has been processed.

\subsection{Creating Observers}

Start by adding a new CSP event observer to the visual element that matches the selector ``\#bully''.
Add the following JavaScript code to your \texttt{template.js} file:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
$("#bully").observe("csp-event", {
  observers: []
});
\end{lstlisting}

The visual element that matches the selector ``\#bully'' defines the parent for the CSP event observer.
In particular, the selector matches the SVG element (the actual visualization) that we added in the previous Section~\ref{tutorial_csp_create_vis}.

In order to associate a \textit{status} event from the CSP specification with a node in the visualization, we use the selector ``\#n-\{\{a1\}\}'' in the definition of the respective observer. 
The construct ``\{\{a1\}\}'' is used in the selector for obtaining the value of the first argument of the respective \textit{status} event.
For example, the observer for changing a status of a node to \texttt{failed} can be defined as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
{
  exp: "{fail.x | x <- {0..N-1}}",
  actions: [
    { selector: "#n-{{a1}}",
      attr: "fill",
      value: "lightgray"
    }
  ]
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=16cm]{img/tutorial/bully1}
	\caption{The Bully Algorithm Visualisation}
	\label{fig:bully1}
\end{figure}

Add this observer to the list of observers.
In line 2 we define the user-defined expression that constitutes the set of observed events.
In this case the expression defines the set of events $\{fail.0, fail.1, fail.2, fail.3\}$ with $N=4$.
Whenever the current processed event is a member of this set, the actions (defined in line 3 to 8) are executed.
In particular, the observer executes only one action that sets the fill attribute of the visual element that matches the selector to lightgray.
Consider line 4: We define the selector based on the value of the first parameter (\{\{a1\}\}) of the current processed event.
For example, if the current processed event is \textit{fail.3}, the selector will be defined as ``\#n-3''.
Refresh your browser and open the ProB Events view (\textsf{Open View $\rangle$ Events}).
Start the \textit{Network} process, execute the \textit{fail.3} event and see that happens with your visualization.
The corresponding node should be coloured in lightgray as demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:bully1}.
In a similar fashion we can define the observers for the other node status changes. 

For creating the \textit{message} observers we need to consider both arguments of the \textit{message} events.
The types of the messages are distinguished by different colours (see Figure \ref{fig:BullyVisState}).
Thus, each \textit{message} observer, except for the \textit{coordinator} observer (this observer has three actions), has two actions: one action for appearing the arrow (the line and arrowhead constituting the respective arrow in the visualization) and one action for changing the color of the arrow.
For instance, the observer for visualising the test message can be defined as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
{
  exp: "{test.x.y | x <- {0..N-1}, y <- {0..N-1}}",
  actions: [
    { selector: "#l-{{a1}}-{{a2}}, #p-{{a2}}",
      attr: "class",
      value: "visible"
    },
    { selector: "#l-{{a1}}-{{a2}}",
      attr: "stroke",
      value: "cyan"
    }
  ]
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=16cm]{img/tutorial/bully2}
	\caption{The Bully Algorithm Visualisation}
	\label{fig:bully2}
\end{figure}

Add the observer to the set of observers.
The first action (line 4 to 7) sets the attribute class to the value ``visible''.
In the next step we need to define the visible and hidden classes respectively.
Add the following code within your head tag in your \texttt{index.html} file:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=html]
<style type="text/css">
  .hidden {
    visible:hidden;
  }
  .visible {
    visible:visible;
  }
</style>
\end{lstlisting}

Refresh your browser and see what happens with your visualization.
For instance, execute the event \textit{test.0.3}.
A directed cyan coloured arrow from node 0 to 3 should be displayed as demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:bully2}.
In a similar fashion we can define the observers for the other message types. 

To provide a clear visualization an additional observer has been added to hide all arrows after performing an arbitrary event.
This observer is applied on the currently processed event before all other defined observers:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
{
  exp: "Events",
  actions: [
    { selector: "path[id^=l-], path[id^=p-]", 
      attr: "class", 
      value: "hidden"
    }
  ]
}
\end{lstlisting}
 
The initial state of the specification and the visualization is the state in the network where all nodes are alive and the coordinator is the node with the ID 3 (the node with the greatest ID). 
Additionally, no message exchanges are performed.
