\section{Overview}

This handbook consists of three parts:

\begin{description}
	\item[Introduction] You are reading the introduction right now.  It helps you to orient yourself and to find information quickly.
	\item[Tutorial] If you are completely new to BMotion Studio, the Tutorial is a good way to get up to speed quickly.  It guides you through installation and usage of the tool and gives you an overview of the BMotion Studio features.
	\item[Reference] The reference section provides comprehensive documentation of BMotion Studio, and its components.
	\item[Frequently Asked Questions] Common issues are listed by category in the FAQ.
	\item[Index] Particularly for the print version of this handbook, we included an index.  In the electronic versions, you may want to try the search functionality as well.
\end{description}

\subsection{Formats of this Handbook}

The handbook comes in various formats:

\begin{description}
	\item[Eclipse Help] BMotion Studio is shipped with Eclipse and can be accessed through the help system.
	%\item[Online Help] You can access the handbook online at \url{http://handbook.event-b.org}.
	\item[PDF Help] The BMotion Studio Website \url{http://www.stups.hhu.de/ProB/index.php5/BMotion_Studio} includes a link to the PDF version of the handbook.
\end{description}

\subsection{Background and Motivation}

Formal methods like the B-Method gained a lot of popularity as approach for the specification and design of software that ensures its safety and reliability. Several industrial projects like the Coppilot System that controls the opening and closing of platform screen doors at the paris metro line 13 have been installed successfully. Such industrial applications need also industrial strength tools in order to support the deployment of formal models. One of them is ProB. ProB is an animation tool with the challange to check the presence of desired functionality and to inspect the behavior of a formal model.

Another challenge for successful deployment of formal models is the communication between a developer and a domain expert (or manager). On the one hand it is crucial for the developer to get feedback from the domain expert for further development. On the other hand the domain expert needs to check whether his expectations are met. Furthermore, good communication and presentation of formal models can help to obtain several contracts. An animation tool like ProB could perform this task, but may be still too difficult for domain experts, because they also need a certain level of knowledge about the mathematical notation to understand the meaning of a specific state. To avoid this problem, it is useful to create domain specific visualizations.

That's why we introduce BMotion Studio for ProB, a tool built on top of the ProB Java API for creating domain specific visualisations of Classical-B, Event-B and CSP models.

\subsection{BMotion Studio Website}
\label{rodin_wiki}

This handbook is complemented by the BMotion Studio for ProB Website (\url{http://www.stups.hhu.de/ProB/index.php5/BMotion_Studio}).  Sometimes, the handbook will refer to the website for more information.

\subsection{Feedback}
\label{feedback}

All online versions of the handbook contain a button or link for feedback.  You can also submit feedback via email to \texttt{ladenberger@cs.uni-duesseldorf.de}.

\section{Conventions}
\label{conventions}

We use the following conventions in this manual:

\tick{Checklists and Milestones are designated with tick. Here we summarize what we want to learn or should have learned so far.}
\info{Useful information and tricks are designated by the information sign.}
\warning{Potential problems and warnings are designated by a warning sign.}
\pencil{Examples and Code are designated by a pencil.}

We use \texttt{typewriter} font for file names and directories.

We use \textsf{sans serif font} for GUI elements like menus and buttons.  Menu actions are depicted by a chain of elements, separated by ``$\rangle$'', e.g. \textsf{File $\rangle$ New $\rangle$ Project...}.

\section{ADVANCE}
\label{advance}

This work has been sponsored by the Advance project\footnote{\url{http://www.advance-ict.eu/}}.  ADVANCE is an FP7 Information and Communication Technologies Project funded by the European Commission. The overall objective of ADVANCE is the development of a unified tool-based framework for automated formal verification and simulation-based validation of cyber-physical systems.

The ADVANCE project is unique in addressing both simulation and formal verification within a single design framework.

Unification is being achieved through the use of a common formal modelling language supported by methods and tools for simulation and formal verification. An integrated tool environment is providing support for construction, verification and simulation of models.

ADVANCE is building on an existing formal modelling language - Event-B - and its associated tools environment - Rodin - with strong support for formal verification. In ADVANCE, Rodin is being further strengthened and augmented with novel approaches to multi-simulation and testing.
