\section{How to Build a Standalone Visualisation}

Clone the BMotion Studio for ProB standalone Github repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ladenberger/bmotion-prob-standalone}} and put your visualisation into the folder ``resources/workspace''.
In the root folder run the following command, where XXX is the path to the html template file in the ``resources/workspace'' folder (e.g. ``myvis/vis.html''):
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
gradle -Pvisualisation="XXX" buildAll
\end{lstlisting}

If you don't have gradle installed, you can use the gradlew script provided:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./gradlew -Pvisualisation="XXX" buildAll
\end{lstlisting}

This should build the binaries without a gradle installation on your computer.
The gradle script will produce a zipped standalone version for all platforms. The zip files are located in the build/distributions folder.
