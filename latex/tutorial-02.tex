\label{tutorial_02}

\subsection{Installation}

Start off by downloading BMotion Studio for your operating system. 
You can find the latest version of BMotion Studio for ProB at \url{http://www.stups.hhu.de/ProB/index.php5/BMotion_Studio}.
Decompress the archive and expand the directory if necessary. 

\warning{Do not change the location and structure of the files and directories within the folder!}

\subsection{First Steps}

Navigate to the \texttt{bin} folder. 
In order to start BMotion Studio enter the bash command as shown in Listing~\ref{lst:bmsstart}.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,language=bash, ,caption={Bash command for starting BMotion Studio for ProB},label=lst:bmsstart]
.\bmotion-prob
\end{lstlisting}
That's all! 
Your default browser should open and show the current workspace of BMotion Studio.
In particular, the workspace includes no visualisations.
The \texttt{lib} folder contains JavaScript libraries that are used by BMotion Studio and that also can be used by the user to create a visualisation.
