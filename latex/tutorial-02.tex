\section{Installation}
\label{tutorial_02}

Start off by downloading \bms~for your operating system. 
You can find the latest version of the tool at \url{http://www.stups.hhu.de/ProB/index.php5/BMotion_Studio}.
Decompress the archive and expand the directory if necessary. 

%\warning{Do not change the location and structure of the files and directories within the folder!}

Navigate to the \texttt{bin} folder and start the tool by entering the bash command:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
.\bmotion-prob
\end{lstlisting}

\info{Windows users should execute the \texttt{bmotion-prob.bat} file.}

That's all! 
Your default browser should open and show the default workspace.
The workspace contains the following predefined folders:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{lib}: This folder contains JavaScript libraries that are needed for BMotion Studio.
\item \texttt{b\_template}: A visualisation template for creating visualisations for Classical-B and Event-B models.
\item \texttt{csp\_template}: A visualisation template for creating visualisations for CSP models.
\end{itemize}
